Training a CNN(Lenet 5) to distinguish between Mnist digits using Pytorch
In this article, I will be showing how to use a Convolutional Neural Network to create a model that should be able to identify digits from 0 to 9 from an image. The dataset is the Mnist dataset which can be directly accessed through PyTorch. The model architecture that will be used is the famous Lenet-5 developed by Yann LeCun.

Here is a great explanation on Youtube about CNNâ€™s:
